Teeko_AI uses a minimax algorithm to play and pick moves against an opponet in Teeko. 

Teeko Game: between two players on a 5x5 board. Each player has four markers of either red or black. 
Beginning with black, they take turns placing markers  until all markers are on the board, the goal of getting four in a row horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, or in a 2x2 box.

If after the drop phase neither player has won, they continue taking turns moving one marker at a timeâ€”to an 
adjacent spaceuntil one player wins.
